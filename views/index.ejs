                    <h3>I help businesses solve problems</h3>

                    <p>I specialise in helping businesses tackle challenges by combining UX, design, and engineering to create, refine, and test digital experiences tailored to user needs. As a conduit between designers, developers, and business analysts, I play a pivotal role throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring a harmonious balance of user requirements and business goals.</p>
                    <p>With a robust creative background, meticulous attention to detail, and a wealth of experience and technical skills, I am adept at steering projects from conception to completion, consistently delivering successful outcomes on time and within budget.</p>
                    <p>Since beginning my career in the digital industry in 2000, I have cultivated a deep passion for digital innovation, a keen eye for detail, and a preference for simplicity. My varied experiences across different work environments have equipped me with the ability to connect with people at all levels, enhancing team dynamics and project efficacy.</p>

                    <h3>How I work</h3>
                    <p>My work philosophy centres around collaborative teamwork in a multidisciplinary environment, sharing a collective vision. Involving clients and stakeholders at every stage fosters a deeper understanding of their business objectives and customer needs. I am a strong proponent of the agile "inspect-and-adapt" methodology, favouring a user-centric, iterative approach that values simplicity and encourages early failure as a pathway to refinement and success.</p>

                    <h3>How much do I charge</h3>
                    <p>Regarding my professional fees, I tailor my approach to each client, considering the unique aspects of every project. My pricing structure varies between a fixed price and a daily rate, depending on the project's scope and nature.</p>

                      <p>I understand that every clients needs, goals and budgets are different.
                      With my experience of working with the smallest startups to the biggest players,
                      no project is too small or too large. I like a challenge!</p>

                  <p>
                    I encourage clients to take the mobile-first responsive approach.
                    Designs that respond and adapt to different screen sizes are far more
                    user friendly and provide a better user experience.

                  <p>
                    I believe it's essential to prototype and wireframe designs. It's the best way to
                    adequately explain ideas and intentions to others. It also gives you
                    the opportunity to see what works or doesnâ€™t by testing and tweaking as you go.
