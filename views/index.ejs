                      <h3>I help businesses solve problems</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                      I bridge the gap between visual designers, developers and business analysts. My involvement 
                      through the entire cycle of a project enables the projects end result to be a rounded 
                      balance of user needs and business goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With the combination of a strong creative background, attention to detail, 
                      along with my extensive experience and technical skills I can deliver on 
                      projects from the initial briefing right through to build, testing and 
                      completion with successful results on time and in budget.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Being in the industry since 2000 I've developed a passion for digital, an eye for detail and appreciation for simplicity. 
                      My experience has given me exposure to different working environments and capabilities so I’m able to connect with people at all levels.

                      <h3>How I work</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                      I like to work as part of a multidisciplinary team in a collaborative environment to a collective vision. 
                      By involving the client and relevant stakeholders at every step of the process you gain a better 
                      understanding of their business goals and the needs of their customers.
                    <p>
                      I embrace the "inspect-and-adapt" aproach of agile development. 
                      For me, it's my preferred way of working and thinking. 
                      I believe in starting with real user needs and keeping it simple. 
                      Failing early, iterate, then iterate again.
                    </p>
                    <header>
                      <h3>My background</h3>
                      <p class="justify">
                        Originally from Sydney Australia, I completed an advanced diploma in graphic design. 
                        Although having started off in print my passion is digital and I've been working within 
                        the digital industry for over 15 years. 
                      </p>
                      <p class="justify">
                        The bulk of my experience comes from when I worked 
                        at <a href="http://www.cbsinteractive.com/" target="_blank">CBS Interactive</a>. 
                        I worked across two countries in the Sydney and London offices. 
                        This gave me the opportunity to move into many challenging roles and across different 
                        the brands - from web designer to senior designer to senior campaign manager to front-end 
                        developer to international designer/developer.
                      </p>
                      <p class="justify">
                        After I left CBS I worked on few contracts in between looking for my next challenging role.
                        I soon joined <a href="http://www.kainos.com">Kainos</a> as a Senior UX Designer. During my two years 
                        at Kainos I worked on several central govermnent projects such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office" target="_bank">Home Office</a>, 
                        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/border-force">Border Force</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice" target="_blank">Ministry of Justice</a>. 
                      </p>
                      <p class="justify">
                        Now my next challenge is starting my own UX design and front-end development consultancy service.

                      <h3>How much do I charge</h3>
                      <p class="justify">
                        Every client is different, so every project is different. Depending on the
                        size and nature of the project I either charge a fixed price or a daily rate.

                      I can seamlessly translate from paper prototypes or flat designs to hand written compliant code that can intergrate into any backend framework and is compatibale across all browsers.

                    I encourage clients to take the mobile-first responsive approach. 
                    Designs that respond and adapt to different screen sizes are far more 
                    user friendly and provide a better user experience.

                    I believe it's essential to prototype and wireframe designs. It's the best way to 
                    adequately explain ideas and intentions to others. It also gives you 
                    the opportunity to see what works or doesn’t by testing and tweaking as you go.
